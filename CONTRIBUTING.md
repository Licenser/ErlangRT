While the project is young and far from Proof of Concept stage,
please keep your contributions to a minimum: something which will
not be changing a lot of code or the architecture, style fixes, bug
fix ideas, clippy warning fixes, typos and formatting etc.

I will be updating these guidelines once the project reaches some
sort of stability.
