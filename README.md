# ErlangRT - Runtime

Erlang Replacement Therapy.
Another attempt to make Erlang runtime (BEAM emulator) in Rust.

Good news: I know what to do. Bad news: I have no clue how to Rust, but will learn.

## Compiling

* Install latest **Rust** and **Cargo** via rustup http://doc.crates.io/
* Run `make` and with the magic of Bash autocomplete see which targets it 
  supports. You might like `make run`, `make doc`, `make test` and `make compile`.
  
## Editing and Code Navigation

I am using and strongly recommend IntelliJ IDEA CE (free version) with
IntelliJ-Rust plugin (available in repositories tab inside IntelliJ).
